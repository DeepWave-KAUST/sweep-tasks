"""The log has to name the selection the run actually uses.

``PoolScheduler`` has two node-selection modes and they are not
interchangeable. With ``random_batch`` set, ``__post_init__`` overwrites the
configured ``n_pools`` with ``ceil(n_cells / random_batch)`` and ``draw``
then ignores ``self.pools`` entirely, sampling a fresh random subset every
iteration. The stage header still printed "N pools" and the per-iteration line
still printed ``it % n_pools`` -- iteration parity dressed up as a selection.
A production cascade logged "2 pools" and "pool 0 / pool 1" for 30 hours while
drawing a fresh random 615 of 652 cells every single iteration.
