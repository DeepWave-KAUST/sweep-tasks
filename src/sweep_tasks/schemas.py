"""Pydantic v2 schemas for serialisable sweep task specs.

These specs are the contract between the CLI / YAML files / future LLM
adapters and the local TaskRunner. They mirror `PropTorch` + `Equation` API
surface and conventions from `examples/_shared/configure_*.py`.

    reused as a denoiser ``D(vp)`` — and adds a plug-and-play regularizer to the

    * ``kind="sds"`` : ``<score-distillation surrogate>`` (stochastic; the runner
      reseeds the RNG identically per rank each apply for DDP sync).

    ``weight_mode`` sets how ``weight`` scales that gradient before it is added

    * ``"relative"`` (default): rescale the diffusion gradient so its norm is

      choice, since the raw RED gradient magnitude (normalised + mean-reduced)
      is tiny and dataset-dependent.
    * ``"absolute"``: add ``weight * grad(loss)`` directly. ``weight`` then lives
      on the (very small) raw scale — typically needs to be ``O(1e3-1e4)``.

    The denoiser bridges the size/distribution gap between the small generative
    model and the FWI grid via ``mode="patch"`` (slide a ``patch`` x ``patch``
    window at ``stride`` — native training size, in-distribution, preferred) or
    ``mode="resize"`` (bilinearly resize the whole field to the training size).

    stronger projection onto the prior.

class ReceiverSmoothingSpec(_Forbid):
    """Lateral averaging over neighbouring receivers, applied to obs AND syn.

    At low frequency a marine record can be noise-dominated trace by trace
    while the signal stays laterally coherent, so averaging neighbouring
    receivers lifts the usable SNR. The operator is a row-normalised
    Gaussian over the receivers' *surface* positions (normalised
    convolution, so a varying receiver density introduces no amplitude
    bias) — see :func:`sweep_tasks.preproc.filter.receiver_smoothing_matrix`.

    ``target`` decides whether the synthetic is smoothed too.

    * ``"both"`` (default) applies the same linear operator to obs and syn,
      so the misfit stays a consistent comparison whatever the operator does
      to the signal. Autograd differentiates through it correctly.
    * ``"obs"`` smooths only the observed record, on the argument that the
      synthetic carries no noise to remove. That is only safe while the
      operator is near-identity on coherent signal — otherwise the inversion
      is asked to reproduce a laterally smeared wavefield that no model can
      generate, and it distorts the model trying.

    Whether ``"obs"`` is safe is a property of the band and sigma, and is
    measurable: smooth a noise-free synthetic and see how much it changes.
    On a field OBN dataset, ``corr(syn, S·syn)`` is 0.992 at 1.5-2 Hz
    with ``sigma_cells=2`` (so ``"obs"`` is defensible there), but 0.916 at
    2-4 Hz and 0.784 at 2-4 Hz with ``sigma_cells=3`` (where it is not).

    Trade-off on sigma: the operator averages across moveout, so the usable
    ``sigma_cells`` shrinks as frequency rises. Measured on the same data by
    comparing the amplitude a real gather retains against a phase-randomised
    control, the signal-to-noise gain peaks near ``sigma_cells=2-3`` at
    1.5-2 Hz and near ``1.5`` at 2-4 Hz; by ``3.0`` the 2-4 Hz signal is

class PlanSamplingConfig(_Forbid):
    """Stochastic per-iter shared-shot sampler (CRG / OBN supershot mode).

    Attach to :class:`ObsPlanConfig.sampling` when the underlying plan is
    ``grouping='crg'`` and you want source-encoded supershot FWI (the
    canonical 3-D OBN training pattern). When unset (default), the runner
    treats ``obs.plan`` as static per-group obs (the CSG path).

    Grouping-agnostic naming: legacy CRG had ``source_lines_per_crg`` /
    ``min_shot_coverage`` — the unified path renames these to
    ``source_lines_per_group`` / ``min_coverage`` because the underlying
    sampler (:func:`sweep_io.seismic_plan.sample_shared_shots_from_plan`)
    operates on any grouping that admits a shared-shot intersection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_coverage
        Drop plan groups whose row count is below this before sampling.
        Mirrors legacy ``encoding_min_coverage``. ``0`` = keep all groups.
    shared_shots_per_iter
        Number of physical shots sampled per iter from the intersection of
        the chosen groups (= the n_shared dimension of the supershot).
        Must be ``> 0`` to enable shared-shot sampling.
    source_lines_per_group, max_traces_per_sourceline
        Hierarchical sub-sampling caps inside the shared-shot intersection.
        ``0`` disables the corresponding cap.
    num_workers
        Sizes the inner ThreadPoolExecutor that performs the per-iter
        SEG-Y reads (no torch DataLoader is involved). Defaults tuned
        for compute > I/O.
    dedup_mode
        Per-iter dedupe at the grid level. When multiple physical shots in
        an encoded supershot snap to the same ``(gx, gy, gz)`` cell, keep
        only one per cell. ``"first"`` keeps the first row, ``"nearest"``
        the row whose model-frame xy is closest to the cell centre.
        ``"none"`` disables.
    trace_cache_bytes
        Optional in-RAM trace cache shared across iters (bytes). Mirrors
        legacy ``--trace-cache-bytes``: keeps hot SEG-Y traces so repeated
        picks avoid cold-Lustre reads. ``0`` disables, ``-1`` = unbounded.
    receiver_first
        Use the receiver-first shared-shot sampler
        (:func:`sweep_io.seismic_plan.sample_shared_shots_receiver_first`)
        instead of the default random-group intersection. Picks ONE target
        shot per iter then the nodes that recorded it, so the per-iter
        supershot sweeps the WHOLE survey instead of collapsing toward the
        centre — fixes the periphery under-sampling of partial-coverage OBN
        surveys. A shot_key->nodes reverse index is built once at setup.
    receiver_first_max_retries
        Re-roll the target shot up to this many times to find one covered by
        ``>= shared_shots_per_iter`` nodes before falling back to the random
        sampler. Only used when ``receiver_first=True``.

    Pair with :class:`FromPlanGeometry` (the two normally share the same
