"""Frequency-selection (frequency-division) source encoding for OBN FWI.

Implements the steady-state comb method (Tromp & Bachmann, 2019, GJI) on the
sweep mode-B super-shot path: every CRG node in the active pool continuously
emits ONE exclusive DFT-comb frequency; the last ``n_p`` samples of the record
form an integer-period window in which the bins are orthogonal, so the window
DFT separates the nodes exactly (deterministic zero crosstalk — no ±1 signs,
no reseeding, no shared-shot intersection sampling).

The observed side is a set of pre-extracted DTFT coefficients (one complex
number per trace per comb bin, fold-averaged onto surface cells by the
extraction job) — after extraction the inversion never touches SEG-Y.

Loss: per-node complex-cosine coherence (GCN),
``J_s = 1 - |<u_s, d_s>| / (|u_s| |d_s|)``, invariant to any per-node complex
scale — the source wavelet spectrum, excitation delay and sensor
coupling/polarity all cancel; NO wavelet input exists in this mode.

Validated end-to-end on a field OBN dataset in the low-frequency band
(multi-node DD):
see the project notes for the validation run.

    The observed-data half of the method, with no solver in it: ``record`` is
    whatever the acquisition (or a forward run) produced, one conventional
    gather per node, and the output is the same npz schema
    :class:`FreqSelTargets` reads and :func:`synthesize_shard` writes.

    ``record``          ``(n_nodes, nt, n_rec)`` or ``(n_nodes, nt, n_rec, 1)``.
    ``node_grid_xyz``   ``(n_nodes, ndim)`` grid indices, (x, z) or (x, y, z).
    ``trace_grid_xyz``  ``(n_rec, ndim)`` shared across nodes, or
                        ``(n_nodes, n_rec, ndim)`` per node.
    ``fold``            optional ``(n_nodes * n_rec,)`` stack count per item;
                        defaults to 1 (one trace per cell, the synthetic case).
    ``dt_record``       sample interval OF THE RECORD, when it differs from the
                        solver's ``comb.dt`` — field data is routinely 2 or
                        4 ms while the solver runs at 1 ms. Comb frequencies
                        are physical (``ks / (n_p * comb.dt)``) and do not
                        change; only the time axis the DTFT integrates over
                        does. Defaults to ``comb.dt``.

    Nodes need not share a trace count: see :func:`extract_shard_gathers` for
    the ragged field case (streamer CRGs, OBN nodes with varying live fold).

    Absolute scale and the time origin do not matter: the GCN misfit is
    invariant to a per-(node, bin) complex factor, which is exactly what a
    source spectrum, an excitation delay or a coupling constant contribute.
    What DOES matter is that ``comb`` here is the comb the inversion will
    configure — :class:`FreqSelTargets` refuses a shard whose ``n_p``, ``dt``
    or ``ks`` disagree.
